This repository is to introduce students to git and Github. It will get more interesting as you follow along. Please may 
sure you are typing on your terminal as you watch me play around with the git commands.

Today, we will be looking at how to push a file to the github page. We will also look at how to pull a file from 
the github page on to the terminal.

We will revisit git add, git commit. We usually use git status to compare what we have on the computer with what is on the github page first. If there are any changes to a file, we will need to git add the file, then git commit. For any commit we add a message with -m. After this we push to the github page with git push. However, the path must have been set prior using git push --set-upstream origin main, if your branch is main or master if otherwise.
